## About The Project

Definition for Mad Libs from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)
> Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game which consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

Definition for Service review from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_review)
> A service review is a review of an organisation's services designed to identify potential service delivery improvements. A Service Review can be used to improve the organisationâ€™s efficiency and effectiveness, and assists in addressing financial sustainability.

Ever need to keep track of the work you've done? Isn't it just tedious to write up a convincing service report that can showcase your potential to the company? You just want to be a good corporate shill but the company won't let you! They just don't understand the workforce like they used too. Forcing you to spend all that time writing about the benefits you did doesn't do the company any good, now does it?! We here at MadLibs MSR Incorporated understand! Use our easy cheesy lemon squeezy tool to help solve all your service report problems. Throw in a few sprinkles of adjectives, nouns and verbs here and there and voila, a service report that would blow any VP away!
